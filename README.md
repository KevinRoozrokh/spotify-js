How to:
To code a web app similar to the one at the domain https://spotify-js-2c6dd.web.app/ using the codebase from https://github.com/KevinRoozrokh/spotify-js, you can follow the following step-by-step guide:

1. Set up the development environment:
   - Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if you haven't already.
   - Choose a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for development.

2. Clone the codebase:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the desired directory where you want to clone the project.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/KevinRoozrokh/spotify-js.git
     ```

3. Install dependencies:
   - Navigate into the project directory:
     ```
     cd spotify-js
     ```
   - Run the following command to install the project dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

4. Configure the app:
   - Create a `.env` file at the root of the project directory.
   - Obtain the necessary credentials and API keys from the Spotify Developer Dashboard.
   - Set the following environment variables in the `.env` file:
     ```
     REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
     REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI=your_redirect_uri
     ```

5. Start the development server:
   - Run the following command to start the development server:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   - This will launch the app in your default web browser, running on `http://localhost:3000`.

6. Explore and modify the code:
   - Open the project in your code editor.
   - Explore the directory structure and familiarize yourself with the codebase.
   - Make any necessary modifications or enhancements to meet your requirements.

7. Test the app:
   - Write and execute tests to ensure the app's functionality works as expected.
   - Use testing frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library for writing and running tests.

8. Build and deploy the app:
   - Once you are satisfied with your modifications, build a production-ready version of the app.
   - Run the following command to create an optimized build:
     ```
     npm run build
     ```
   - Deploy the built files to a hosting service like Firebase Hosting or another hosting platform of your choice.

9. Continuously maintain and update the app:
   - Monitor and address any reported issues or bugs.
   - Implement new features or improvements based on user feedback.
   - Keep your dependencies up to date by regularly updating them.

Please note that this guide assumes you have basic knowledge of React.js and how to work with Node.js and npm. Additionally, ensure you have obtained the necessary credentials and API keys from the Spotify Developer Dashboard as mentioned in step 4.
